#Yii Fixture Generator
Use this script for easy and consistent Yii fixture generation. This script will read in user input on table name, column names, and values and generate a corresponding PHP file that Yii can use with the PHPUnit testing framework.
To use, just run the command:
```bash
$ php generator.php

```
and the script will handle building the fixtures.

#TODO
+ Item alias for using a specific fixture
+ custom filename
+ loop script once complete for creating another fixture file
